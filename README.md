This is a complicated example of what is possible with a theme.

Themes consist of css, javascript and supporting files, BUT NOT HTML.

All css and javascript files will be loaded what a page is loaded so it is valid
to break javascript and stylesheets into multple files. 

Stylesheets must end in the ".css" extension.

Javascript must end in the ".js" extension.

Style rules will target HTML ids and classes that already exist within the
ILP, as will Javascript.

Anything that can be done with JavaScript or CSS is fair game, so be warned.

Though there are SASS files anda  gulp file included in this example, the ILP itself
does no compiling or transformation on any of the files.  It is included to give an
example of a workflow that results in files that are usable for the ILP's theme
system.
